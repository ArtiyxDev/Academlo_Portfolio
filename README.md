## üìà Areas for Improvement

This project is a great start, but there are always ways to improve it. Here are some suggestions for future work:

-   **Accessibility (a11y):** Conduct a full accessibility audit to ensure the site is usable by everyone. This includes checking color contrast, keyboard navigation, and proper ARIA attribute usage.
-   **Performance Optimization:**
    -   **Image Optimization:** Compress images and serve them in modern formats like WebP or AVIF to reduce load times.
    -   **Lazy Loading:** Implement lazy loading for images and components that are not in the initial viewport.
-   **Testing:**
    -   **Unit Tests:** Add unit tests for components and hooks using a framework like [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/).
    -   **End-to-End Tests:** Implement end-to-end tests with a tool like [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) or [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) to automate user flow testing.
-   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Set up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to automate the testing and deployment process.
-   **SEO:** Enhance Search Engine Optimization by adding more meta tags, generating a sitemap, and using a library like [React Helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet) to manage document head content.
-   **Refactor i18n:** While the current implementation works, consider using a dedicated i18n library like [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) for more advanced features and better scalability.
-   **Code Refinements:** Some larger components could be broken down into smaller, more reusable ones to improve maintainability.
